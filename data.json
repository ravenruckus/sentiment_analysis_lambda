"When I was little my mom used to brush my long silky hair but now I sit in her hospital room and watch her struggle to breathe while I twirl my fingers around my wiry hair. So one day I was waiting for visiting time and treating myself to an ice-cream cone and a walk along the long sidewalk of the shorefront when I came across an animal shelter. I stood their in front of the shelter that looked more like the candy stores from my childhood as chocolate ice-cream ran over the back of my hand. Why would they put this here as if they were trying to sell puppies like slabs of fudge? I was late later that day to visit my mom because I was cleaning puppy urine up off of my new hardwood floor in my dinning room. She, the puppy, is waiting for me, I assume, in the guest bathroom on the bottom floor of my house.."
